# THIS IS A MODULE IN THE PROJECT CALLED API DISPENSER
- The main purpose of this is to secure the API that we were given by the bulk sms provider
- This is to ensure security of the API from unauthorized access after usage
- This is a server and the execution starts at index.js

## index.js
- We determine if it has the correct consumer key "..." where access is allowed 
- The api key is then dispensed
- That is all about this module
